<h2>What is a Business Continuity Plan?</h2>
A business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster. <br>

<br />

<h2>Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Process:</h2>
This tends to involve a 4 step process:<br />
1. <strong>Analysis (Risk evaluation and determine business impact)

<br />

<h2>Types of Phishing Emails</h2>
1. Reconnaissance Email<br>
2. Credential Harvester<br>
4. Vishing<br>
5. Smishing<br>
6. Whaling<br>
7. Malicious File<br>
8. Spam Email<br>
<br>
<h2>Reconnaissance Emails:</h2>
Also know as Recon Emails, have one vital goal in mind and that is to get a response from the recipient. That recipient doesn't even have to reply to the message from the sender as the sender has numerous tools of telling if a message delivered successfully.<br>
<strong>Examples of Recon Emails in the real world:</strong> <br>
1. Spam Email with nothing but random letters in the body of the email like "tgahsdgahj" (Spam Recon Email).<br>
2. Emails that try to use social-engineering techniques to eristic a response. (Social Engineering Recon Email).<br>
3. Emails that use tracking pixels to see if the email was viewed. (Tracking Pixel Recon Email).<br>

<strong>Spam Recon Emails:</strong><br>
<p align="center">
Attackers are simply looking to see if a email error "undeliverable" is returned, if it is returned the email is in use, if it is not the email is in use.

Social Engineer techniques like impersonation, using a sense of urgency, and using impersonation of someone with a high standing to achieve goal of getting a response.<br>

<p align="center">
<strong>Tracking Pixel Recon Email:</strong><br>
 <p align="center">
Email that can be spam or social engineering that is combined with a tracking pixel, this allows the attacker to see if the email was viewed.This allows the attacker to see how active that email address is by looking at the time spam between sending the email and opening the email. A code using HTML code in the email body links to a pixel server. Once email is opened a message back to the server.<br>
Information that can gathered via Pixel:<br>
- Ip address<br>
- Date/Time email opened<br>
- Client Used (Webmail or Email)<br>
- Mobile or Desktop<br>

<h2>Credential Harvester Emails</h2>
<p align="center">
Credential Harvesters are considered the most common phishing email, it uses human weakness and fear to retrieve valid credentials users use on everyday services and accounts. The emails are set up to look like a legit email from a company such as impersonating Amazon,AT&T, and Outlook. This email will have a attached link, that impersonating a real login portal. The user enters the credentials and it is then stored in a directory or email back to the attacker.<br>

<br />

<p align="center">
<h2>Vishing</h2>
<p align="center">
While technically not a email attack. Vishing is a phishing attack done through a phone call.<br>
Example: The attacker calls the victim saying they are from their bank or another institution and informs them that there is a problem with their account or credit card. They will try and pry sensitive information via the phone call.<br>

<h2>Smishing</h2>
<p align="center">
While technically not a email attack. Smishing is a phishing attack done through text message.<br>
Example: The attacker poses as the IRS and threatens the recipient with arrest and financial ruin unless they call the number in the text. If the recipient calls, they get scammed into sending money.<br>

<p align="center">
<h2>False Postive</h2>
A False Positive are emails that are not sent by an attacker and are actually legit. This can occur because of poor formatting of the email, email is not expected and asks for a action, user thinks its malicious, user is bad at identifying phishing emails.<br>
