<h2>Description</h2>
This lab will explain Business Continuity Plans amd for demonstration purposes I have a fictional tech company similar to Apple and how they may make a Business Continuity Plan. This fictional Tech company is called Kiwi and it is a direct competitor to Apple, Google, and Samsung. <br>



<h2>What is a Business Continuity Plan?</h2>
A business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster. <br>

<br />

<h2>Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Process:</h2>
This tends to involve a 4 step process:<br />
<br /> 1. <strong>Analysis</strong> (Risk evaluation and determine business impact)<br /> 
 <br /> 2.<strong>Design</strong> (Develop recovery strategies) <br /> 
<br /> 3.<strong>Implement</strong> (Implement the solution)<br /> 
 <br />4.<strong>Test</strong> (Test your plan in different scenarios and ensure the plan is updated regularly)  <br /> 
<br />

<h2>Types Business Continuity</h2>
1. Operational - Are systems and processes that are mission critical able to function without disruption? (Outages with mission critical services, Issues in Supply Chain, and Product failures)<br>
2. Technological - Are the technologies that the organization relies can ensure the integrity of their system? (Data loss, Hardware failure, and telecom outages)<br>
3. Economic - Is the organization able to still be profitable during a  economic issue (Recession and Financial loss)<br>
4. Workforce - Having enough staff, right staff, that can handle work in turmoil. (Workplace strikes, Loss of essential employee, not scaling the department)<br>
5. Safety - Having a safe work environment for employees. (Pandemics, Occupational hazards, Workplace emergencies)<br>
6. Environmental - Being able to operate efficiently and safely in work setting. (Severe weather and Natural hazards) <br>
7. Security -Making sure business assets are secure from breach that can effect operation, safety, and reputation. (Theft, Vandalism, and Cyberattacks)<br>
<br>
<h2>Difference between Business Continuity vs Disaster Recovery </h2>
AWhile a Disaster Recovery Plans are apart of the large umbrella of a Business Continuity Plan, a Disaster Recovery Plan is a more technical plan used when recovering from a failure. A Business Continuity Plan is way figuring out the relationship during crisis. .<br>

<h2>Kiwi Business Continiuty Plan </h2> 
 <h2>Purpose</h2> 
 A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a process of system prevention and recovery from potential threats to organizations like our own at Kiwi. With a BCP the main goal is to ensure that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function during a disaster. <br>
 
 <h2>Scope</h2> 
 Kiwi, operates solely out of its only Headquarters in Brooklyn, New York with 50 % of employees working onsite and 50 % working via Work From Home (WFH ) model. While having a onsite model our organization is more easily affected by typical causes of business disruptions like natural disasters (Snow Storm, Flash Flooding, and Hurricanes), Workplace equipment failure, Terrorist Attacks, Global Pandemics and Telecommunications Outages. While our Work From Home (WFH) is not effected by these typical causes of business disruption we do still face challenges. Our BCP works in conjunction with the Disaster Recover Plan (DRP) we have created.<br>

 <h2>Procedure</h2>  
 BCP for Employees (WFH)<br>
Kiwi is essentially 50/50 in terms of both being a remote company and an onsite organization. In terms of (WFH) plans are much more simpler as of vendors such as Google and Microsoft are bound to their Service Level Agreements as they host our data and services. As we further transition to a full WFH workforce an advantage will be if a Team within Kiwi become unavailable and cannot complete their work, Kiwi will still be available to operate. <br>

The exception being situations where there is a single point of failure. In example, the Lead engineer who has final say in triggering the BCP plan is unavailable due to tornado that wiped out all communication in the engineers area for several weeks). We would have to find an alternate way of getting in contact with this engineer or develop a new plan to have a second designated final approver when the first approver is unavailable.<br>
 
 BCP for Employees (Onsite)<br>
Kiwi as stated before is essentially 50/50 in terms of both being  a remote company and a onsite organization. In terms of onsite plans its much more difficult as there is bevy of factors that can effect Business Continuity. Here below I will list some of the causes of business disruptions affecting Kiwi onsite employees and plans to counteract them. <br>
 
 Global Pandemics<br>
This is relevantly recent as of 2020 global pandemic COVID-19 which affected all businesses across the world as they were unprepared in their Business Continuity Plans regarding a global pandemic. This was no different for us a Kiwi as we did not plan for a global pandemic and will make our best efforts to plan further ahead for situations that may arise in our ever expanding world. Currently we have taken the appropriate steps to come up with a Business Continuity Plan in the event of another global pandemic or global health emergency. The plan is  segment site availability for designated time slots for employees or allowing employees to work from home as they will be able to access data remotely. If it is required an employee must come to the office they must remain isolated arrive at their designated time slot, pass a health screening, wear a mask, and have the current medical records in terms of shots up to date by 1/1/23<br>
 
 
 Unplanned Telecommunication Outages<br>
Business rely heavily on telecommunications working properly to be able to conduct business to most organizations this is consider a mission critical asset. At Kiwi telecommunication is mission critical, if we cannot communicate internally with our colleagues or with our customers it will result in an estimated financial loss of $250,000 for every hour telecommunications are down . In the event our telecommunications provider Spectrum has an outage that has a Meantime to Repair (MTR) over1 Hour until services are up and running. All employees will receive onsite their own personal hotspot to perform essential duties only until Spectrum resolves the issue. <br>

 
Serve Weather (Flooding or Snow) <br>
In the event of serve weather such as flooding or snow we urge all employees to use there best judgement before making the commute to the onsite office to ensure their safety. All Kiwi employees are allowed to work from home as long as they have their company laptops and an acceptable internet connection. In times of weather related state of emergencies Kiwiâ€™s onsite office will be closed and will not reopen until the state of emergency is over and it is the next business day.  <br>
